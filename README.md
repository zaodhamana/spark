# README.md file for Apache Spark
This is going to be the first tutorial to learn about resilient distributed datasets management with Apache Spark.
Apache Spark will then be linked to scala to play a key role in data management, data transformations, data actions.
I also seem to be relying more and more on VSCode in coding rather than Eclipse because of the ease of use of the terminal and its ease of using git. 
I'll use README.md to log my progress on data management tutorials.
